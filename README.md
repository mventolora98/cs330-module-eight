I started by designing a 3D setting for my final project using basic geometric principles that I had previously covered in my milestones, such turning a 2D square into a 3D box. My strategy for creating the software was to expand on that framework by incorporating object interactions, lighting, and texturing. I organized my process by testing each new feature incrementally, first making sure object rendering functioned properly, then adding shaders, and lastly incorporating collision and movement logic. Using a SceneManager, ShaderManager, and ViewManager in a modular fashion allowed me to keep my OpenGL software clearly organized. It was particularly satisfying to experiment with ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting since it helped me comprehend how different materials react to light sources, which gave my scene more depth and authenticity.

Several strategies that were acquired during the course have to be combined in order to execute the final scene. I used dynamic objects to show how user input and scene behavior might be combined, like bricks that would react to collisions when the spacebar was pressed. Debugging was a continuous effort; to make sure my texture coordinates were mapped correctly, I often checked for shader compilation issues. Resolving rendering problems required an understanding of how vertex data interacts with shaders. I learnt to identify the issue, examine logs, and improve my code every time I ran into a difficulty. This project reaffirmed the value of progressive testing in graphics programming and improved my ability to troubleshoot methodically.

My understanding of how programming and mathematics interact to create computer graphics has grown as a result of completing this course. I learned the value of coordinate systems, lighting models, and camera control—all essential for contemporary visualization tools and game development—through the process of turning 2D ideas into interactive 3D settings. My career objective of enhancing pharmacy software with more user-friendly visual interfaces will be directly supported by these abilities, as will my next education in software design and interactive systems. I've learned how to think creatively and spatially through computational graphics, combining creativity and logic to produce captivating user experiences.
